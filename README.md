# Iterative-Transformers
Skoltech NLA project on Iterative weight-sharing implementation of attention mechanisms

We found out that the very same idea was used in ALBERT. Thus we aim to rebuild the same system and test the applicability and capabilities of weight-sharing.

Tasks:
- Reproduce ALBERT
- Test different learning strategies
- Bootstrap Anderson Acceleration for transformer blocks to make convergence faster
